        <h1>Trump Tariffs</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <p class="typing">As for your perspective on Trump’s tariffs, I understand your view of him as more performative than strategic, and I’d like to offer insight into the tariff plan, which uses Oren Cass’s work at American Compass to revive U.S. manufacturing. Below, I will address all your concerns, including why you likely believe Trump isn't telling anyone about his plans.
<br><br>
You can read Cass's report, "The Once and Future Worker", in its book form if you search for it. But you can read his material at <a href="https://americancompass.org">American Compass</a> or watch this <a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/washington-journal/oren-cass-on-the-once-and-future-worker/518730">interview on CSPAN</a> where he discusses the economic plan. As I said, you can also watch his interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgEQeLR-M0g">Jon Stewart about understanding Trump's tariffs</a> and many others on YouTube.</p>

            <h2>Addressing Your Concerns</h2>
            <h3>1. Purpose Beyond "Bringing Manufacturing Back"</h3>
            <p class="typing">The tariffs aim to boost domestic production, reduce trade deficits, protect national security, and raise revenue. Cass’s <a href="https://americancompass.org/the-case-for-a-strategic-tariff/">The Case for a Strategic Tariff</a> argues manufacturing is vital for jobs, innovation, and resilience, protecting industries like steel and semiconductors.</p>

            <h3>2. Tariffs as Negotiation Leverage</h3>
            <p class="typing">Tariffs are used as a "stick" for better trade terms, as you noted. High rates (e.g., 145% on China) push deals, like the UK’s 10% tariff agreement or Japan’s $550B investment. Fluctuating rates are negotiation tactics, later reduced (e.g., to 30% and 10% post-truce).</p>

            <h3>3. Trade Deficits</h3>
            <p class="typing">You’re right that deficits aren’t inherently "losing money." But Cass and the administration see the $1.2T goods deficit (2024) as a loss of wages (see the 50-year productivity-wage gap) where $30-per-hour jobs were replaced with $5-per-hour jobs in China, and as a sign of dependency, per the April 2025 "national emergency" declaration: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/04/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our/">White House Fact Sheet</a>.</p>

            <h3>4. Fluctuating Rates</h3>
            <p class="typing">Shifting rates (15% to 145%) seem chaotic but are strategic, e.g., China’s 145% tariff included a 20% "fentanyl" component, later cut to 30%. This risks market turmoil, as seen in the 2025 crash: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/trump-tariffs-sow-fears-trade-wars-recession-2300-iphone-2025-04-04/">Reuters</a>.</p>

            <h2>Critique and Context</h2>
            <p class="typing">Messaging can feel simplistic (e.g., Trump’s X posts). Critics warn tariffs raise prices ($1,300/household, 2025). Cass’s vision bets on long-term industrial gains despite short-term pain.</p>
